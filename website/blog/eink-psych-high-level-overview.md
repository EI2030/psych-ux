### Color and phone addiction

Anectodal - switching to a black and white screen reduces addiction of phone as it makes apps less visually appealing (e.g. instagram, tik-tok)

### Negative impact on sleep
There seems to be a clear consensus that using phones/devices before sleep disturbs sleep, particularly in young people. I know there is plenty of discussion around "blue-light" and many products that focus on that aspect specifically. Where I have not (yet) found clear research is in breaking down the different variables and their impact - there is the screen itself, the interaction with digital content (and all the varying content types), etc.
