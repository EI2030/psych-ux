# Eink psych - Literature review

The aim of this document is to compile existing research that has been conducted comparing eink and LCDs/OLEDs on areas such as visual fatigue, reading ability/anything that seems important for productivity and wellbeing!

Getting together the existing research will help us work out exactly where the knowledge gap is!

Anyone and everyone is welcome and invited to contribute!

#### Research Question:
Do eink vs LCD vs Book trigger different levels of visual fatigue over a prolonged reading period (70 mins)?


#### Method:

<br/>

* Each participant came into the lab 3 times over the course of 10 days

* Each time they came into the lab, they had to read for 70 mins on one of the devices
* Each participant read on each of the different devices
* Analysis was conducted “within participant” (i.e. comparing each participants’ visual fatigue against only their own visual fatigue after each different device



* Participants’ visual fatigue was measured in three ways
    * (1) Critical Flicker Frequency
        * A flickering stimulus was presented. 
        * There is a visual illusion in which this flickering stimulus appears not to flicker, but as a single continuous stimulus
        * Participants required to indicate whether an actually stationary stimulus had started flickering
        * The idea being that if they were slower/less good at doing that then they were more visually fatigued
    
    * Eye blinks
        * Less frequent eye blinks indicate visual fatigue
        * Eye tracking cameras were used to record rate of eye blinks
    * Visual fatigue questionnaire
        * Participants indicated level of agreement with statements (e.g. I have difficulties seeing, My eyes feel tired) on a 7-point scale

* Before and after the reading session, participants performed measures (1) and (3). (2) was measured during reading.

<br/>

#### Findings:
* No difference between eink, LCD, book on the critical flicker frequency score (measure (1))
* Significantly fewer blinks during LCD than during both eink and book reading (which were not significantly different)
* Visual fatigue questionnaire ratings were highest following LCD, followed by eink followed by book

#### Take aways
* According to eye blink and self-report questionnaire, LCD causes more visual fatigue than eink
* Could be worthwhile to explore other potential visual fatigue measures
    * E.g. attention lapsing?

* Key aspect of the study was the reading session length – sessions were 70 minutes
    * Nonetheless, average time staring at laptop screen probably much greater than this >>> key area for research to target.

* The researchers thought further research should investigate: how does luminance level modulate their findings?

## Research Ideas

* investigating the difference between using e-ink vs LCD over a long period of time (e.g. a full 8 hour working day rather than 30 min sessions)

    * Would be relevant to also see about using a mix, as I can imagine many/most wouldn't be able to use e-ink exclusively.
    * Areas where anecdotally one might possibly expect some interesting findings:
decreased rate of mental fatigue over a full days work for an e-ink user, which perhaps translates to more available cognitive resources for e.g. thinking about hard maths problems, writing etc.  

* maybe some stuff to do with screen addiction
